# MineOS-Lang-File-Reader
Script for simplifying the process of translating MineOS Language (.lang) files

All you have to do in put this program in the same folder (directory) as a file named "English.lang" (can be changed by changing "READ" variable in script) and run the program, and it will give you a big block of text inside of ('') for you to copy and paste into a translator, and then you copy the translated text and paste back into the program. Then it will ask if the translator is good, like if it doesn't add spaces to the original or not. Google Translate is bad and the program has to try to fix data. In some cases the fixing process is not enough and you may have to manually fix a few segments of the translated output. For the most part it works fairly well, and when it finnishes properly will ask you for the language name, and will save everything to "<language name>.lang" in the same folder.

Versions:
